"""Management command ``create_dummy_data``: interactively seed a workspace with fake data.

Prompts for a new workspace, its owner and members, then for each project the
number of issues/cycles/modules/pages/intake issues, and hands the work to
``plane.bgtasks.dummy_data_task.create_dummy_data``. Intended for local/dev use.
